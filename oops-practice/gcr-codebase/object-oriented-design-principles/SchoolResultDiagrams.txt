Sample Problem 1: School Results Application
===================================================

1. Class Diagram
-----------------------------------------------------

description:
this application is used to calculate student results.
a student studies many subjects and grade is calculated
using marks of subjects.

classes used:
- Student

- Subject
- GradeCalculator

relationships:
- Student and Subject has aggregation relation
- GradeCalculator uses Student to calculate grade

aggregation is used because subject can exist without
student also.

        +------------------+
        |     Student      |
        +------------------+
        | - name           |
        | - rollNumber     |
        +------------------+

                 uses

note:
◇ symbol shows aggregation relationship


2. Object Diagram
-----------------------------------------------------

description:
object diagram shows real objects at a particular time.
it shows values inside the objects.

example:
student name is john
subjects are maths and science
marks are 90 and 85

object diagram (text format):

student1 : Student

name = "John"

subject1 : Subject

subjectName = "Maths"
marks = 90

subject2 : Subject

subjectName = "Science"
marks = 85

3. Sequence Diagram
-----------------------------------------------------

description:
sequence diagram shows how objects talk to each other
step by step.

scenario:
student wants to see his grade.
student asks grade calculator.
calculator calculates grade and return result.

actors:
- Student
- GradeCalculator

sequence diagram (text format):

Student            GradeCalculator
   |                       |
   | requestGrade()        |
   |---------------------> |
   |                       |
   | calculateGrade()      |
   |<--------------------- |
   |                       |
   | displayGrade()        |
